Sandbox is a place for experimental and temporary files that are not yet ready to be accessed in ‘production.’
If you are looking for the experimental Histogram analysis methods, they were moved to the histomethod package in the 
Genesis home directory. The original versions of those files are found in: “GenSIP/old/old_sandbox”
