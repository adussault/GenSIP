GenSIP CHECKLIST

IDEAS:
- Correlate the loss of the Mo in the SEM images with the loss of Mo in the ICP data. This should give some insight into the mechanism of Mo loss, whether it is mechanical flaking or if the top layer is being taken off across the whole foil. How much data is actually being lost? is it being lost across the whole foil, or just in isolated areas where the Mo is being stripped off?

- Mo-Pt compare:
- can correlate two images and apply logical operations on the pixels to determine if they are Pt or not.
