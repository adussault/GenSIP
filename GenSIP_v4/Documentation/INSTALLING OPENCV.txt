INSTALLING OPENCV WITH PYTHON SUPPORT ON YOUR MAC:

Andrew Dussault - March 20, 2015
Instructions taken from: 
https://jjyap.wordpress.com/2014/05/24/installing-opencv-2-4-9-on-mac-osx-with-python-support/
(With modifications from around the web and the Homebrew doctor.)

1. In the Terminal shell:
	brew tap homebrew/science
   Get version info. Look at the info for opencv to see what the required
   dependencies are and whether or not they are installed.:
	brew info opencv
	brew install opencv
   Opencv should be in this location, assuming the version number is up-to-
   date:
	cd /usr/local/Cellar/opencv/2.4.10.1

2. Set up python: 
	cd /Library/Python/2.7/sitepackages
	ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/opencv/2.4.9/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cv.py cv.py
	ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/opencv/2.4.9/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cv2.so cv2.so

3. Try importing cv and cv2 in python. If it works, you are done! However…

4. If you are getting a segmentation fault when you try to import cv or cv2 
   from python:

   Check brew doctor to see if there is a problem. It should indicate that
   the python you are using is the system’s Python and not Homebrew’s. 
	1. type in shell: 
		which python
	  if it returns
		/usr/bin/python
	  then it is the wrong python

	   You should also be able to tell based on the version number of
	  python that comes up when you run python. It should be the latest 
	  version (2.7.9) if not (i.e. 2.7.5) you are likely using the
	  system’s python

	   The computer will default to the system-provided programs over 
	  Homebrew’s provided programs if usr/bin occurs before usr/local/bin
	  in the PATH (explained in brew doctor)

	2. To use Homebrew’s python, you need to set your PATH so that usr/
	   local/bin comes first. Run the following line:
		echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
	3. Close and open your terminal window and you should be able to
	   import cv and cv2 just fine in python. 

4. If the problem persists, some libraries may not be linked. This should be 
   evident in “brew info opencv.” You may need to link the following:
	brew link libpng
	brew link libjpeg
	brew link libtiff

5. You are done!
